    "- Objects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object. This is known as **aliasing** in other languages. This is usually not appreciated on a first glance at Python, and can be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, tuples). However, aliasing has a possibly surprising effect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, dictionaries, and most other types. \n",
    "- This is usually used to the benefit of the program, since **aliases behave like pointers** in some respects. For example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the implementation; and **if a function modifies an object passed as an argument, the caller will see the change** — this eliminates the need for two different argument passing mechanisms as in Pascal."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "- A **namespace** is a mapping from names to objects. **Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries**, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. \n",
    "- **Examples** of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as abs(), and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. \n",
    "- In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The important thing to know about namespaces is that **there is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces**; for instance, two different modules may both define a function `maximize` without confusion — users of the modules must prefix it with the module name.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- Strictly speaking, **references to names in modules are attribute references**: in the expression `modname.funcname`, `modname` is a module object and `funcname` is an attribute of it. In this case there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module's attributes and the global names defined in the module: they share the same namespace!\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- Attributes may be read-only or writable. In the latter case, assignment to attributes is possible. Module attributes are writable: you can write `modname.the_answer=42`. \n",
    "Writable attributes may also be deleted with the `del` statement. For example, `del modname.the_answer` will remove the attribute `the_answer` from the object named by `modname`.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- Namespaces are created at different moments and have different **lifetimes**. The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter quits. The statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script file or interactively, are considered part of a module called **`__main__`**, so they have their own global namespace. (The built-in names actually also live in a module; this is called **`builtins`^^.)\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- The local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function. (Actually, forgetting would be a better way to describe what actually happens.) Of course, recursive invocations each have their own local namespace.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- A **scope** is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- Although **scopes are determined statically**, they are **used dynamically**. At any time during execution, there are at least three nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:\n",
    "  - the **innermost scope**, which is searched first, contains the local names\n",
    "  - the **scopes of any enclosing functions**, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-global names\n",
    "  - the **next-to-last scope** contains the current module’s global names\n",
    "  - the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- If a name is declared **global**, then all references and assignments go directly to the middle scope containing the module’s global names. To rebind variables found outside of the innermost scope, the nonlocal statement can be used; if not declared **`nonlocal`**, those variables are read-only (an attempt to write to such a variable will simply create a new local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically named outer variable unchanged).\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- Usually, the local scope references the local names of the (textually) current function. Outside functions, the local scope references the same namespace as the global scope: the module’s namespace. Class definitions place yet another namespace in the local scope.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- It is important to realize that scopes are determined textually: the global scope of a function defined in a module is that module’s namespace, no matter from where or by what alias the function is called. On the other hand, the actual search for names is done dynamically, at run time — however, the language definition is evolving towards static name resolution, at “compile” time, so don’t rely on dynamic name resolution! (In fact, local variables are already determined statically.)\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- A special quirk of Python is that – if no **`global`** or **`nonlocal`** statement is in effect – assignments to names always go into the innermost scope. **Assignments do not copy data — they just bind names to objects**. The same is true for deletions: the statement **`del x`** **removes the binding** of x from the namespace referenced by the local scope. In fact, **all operations that introduce new names use the local scope**: in particular, **`import`** statements and function definitions bind the module or function name in the local scope.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- The **`global`** statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be rebound there; the **`nonlocal`** statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there."

Thus, if an attribute is not found in `DerivedClassName`, it is searched for in `Base1`, then (recursively) in the base classes of `Base1`, and if it was not found there, it was searched for in `Base2`, and so on.\n",

This approach is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as call-next-method and is more powerful than the super call found in single-inheritance languages.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "- Dynamic ordering is necessary because **all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond relationships** (where at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class). For example, all classes inherit from `object`, so any case of multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach `object`. To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right ordering specified in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without affecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these properties make it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with multiple inheritance. For more detail, see https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/."
